/**
 * Central Framer Motion wrapper for client components.
 * - Avoids `export *` so Next.js App Router / Turbopack doesn't flag wildcard re-exports in a client boundary.
 * - Re-export only the primitives actually used in the app for better tree-shaking.
 * - Add more named exports here (while still avoiding wildcard exports) as needs grow.

// If you later need LazyMotion or domAnimation/domMax feature bundles, import and re-export them explicitly here:
