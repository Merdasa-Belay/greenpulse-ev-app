      "content": "• Standardised Safety Colours: While you are asking about document templates, the sources emphasize that certain colours in the physical vehicle are strictly regulated for safety. Specifically, High-Voltage (HV) cables must be identified by a bright orange colour to warn of high-voltage risks.\n• Branding Context: The sources mention specific vehicle examples, such as the VW Golf-e and components from manufacturers like Tesla (as seen in the provided images), but these are used for technical illustration rather than as a guide for document styling.\nSince the sources do not cover document formatting or branding permissions, you may need to consult the original creators—green pulse ev service and training—or your organisation's internal brand guidelines to determine if the header and cover colours can be updated. This information is not present in the provided technical excerpts and should be verified independently.",
